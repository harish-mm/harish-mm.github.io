Over the course of 2 months in my internship at Tarides(May to July 2023), I
worked on developing `Par_incr`, which is an `OCaml` library for incremental
computation. This article will act as a documentation for library internals and
also as an educational material for folks wanting to learn about
adaptive/incremental computations. The library is based on
[Efficient Parallel Self-Adjusting Computation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/130-sCY1YPzo4j3YAJ7EL9-MflK0l8RmJ/view?pli=10)
